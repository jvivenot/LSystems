I recently stumbled upon an old ruby/gtk application I made years ago (around 2004, when I was in my late years in High School) intending to provide an helpful GUI to play around with the wonderful L-Systems.
Figured I could update it and get to draw new beautiful things with a deterministically dumb turtle.
